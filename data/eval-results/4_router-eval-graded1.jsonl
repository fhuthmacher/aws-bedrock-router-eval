The main difference is that the generated query uses JULIANDAY() function to calculate the difference between dates, while the groundtruth query directly subtracts the dates.\n\nFaultless (1 point):\nThe generated SQL query ran without any errors, as indicated by the empty sql_query_run_error field.\n\nValid Efficiency Score (0 points):\nThe Valid Efficiency Score (VES) of 0.0 suggests that the runtime of the generated SQL query is not similar or better than the groundtruth query. This could be due to the use of the JULIANDAY() function, which may be less efficient than directly subtracting dates.","usage":"[{\"inputTokens\": 1577, \"outputTokens\": 94, \"totalTokens\": 1671},

Context: The generated SQL query uses only the information provided in the SQL schema, without introducing any external or fabricated details. It selects from the employees and orders tables and joins them based on the employee_id foreign key relationship. Therefore, I will award 1 point for this criterion.\n\n2. Completeness: The generated SQL query addresses the key elements of the question by calculating the average order processing time (difference between shipped_date and order_date) for each employee. It groups the results by employee to get the average for each one. However, the Exact Set Match Accuracy (EM) score is 0.0, indicating that the result set does not fully answer the question. Therefore, I will not award a point for this criterion.\n\n3. Execution Accuracy: The Execution Accuracy score is 0.0, which means the generated SQL query is not a match with the groundtruth answer. Therefore, I will not award a point for this criterion.\n\n4. Faultless: The generated SQL query ran without any errors, as indicated by the empty sql_query_run_error field. Therefore, I will award 1 point for this criterion.\n\n5. Valid Efficiency Score: The Valid Efficiency Score (VES) is 0.0, which suggests that the runtime of the generated SQL query is not similar or better than the groundtruth query. Therefore, I will not award a point for this criterion.","usage":"[{\"inputTokens\": 1568, \"outputTokens\": 101, \"totalTokens\": 1669}, {\"inputTokens\": 1539, \"outputTokens\": 107,
