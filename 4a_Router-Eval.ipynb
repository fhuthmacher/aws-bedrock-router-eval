    "### Intro and Goal\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is designed to test an LLM (Large Language Model) routing system on a Text-to-SQL use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to take a prompt, determine the level of complexity and then route the prompt either to a small or large LLM to generate the corresponding SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. **Create a ground truth dataset comprised of questions and SQL queries for a given database (e.g. Northwind) (notebook 4a)**\n",
    "2. Define Router (notebook 4b)\n",
    "3. Evaluate accuracy, cost, and latency of LLM classifier router approach compared to the baseline of using a larger LLM for all queries. (notebook 4b)"
